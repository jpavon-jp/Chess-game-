Josue Pavon Explanation

Hello Professor Here is the explanation of the part of code that I worked. I worked on the main menu and the game rules code, and also on the visual design. And also I was the one that made the readme.

The most challenging part for me was to finding the paths for the images and files, basically to make it to search and find the images in the directory. Also it what a bit hard for me to organize the objects in a way to make it user friendly.

What I have leaned was to finding the paths for the images and files and making myself improove my designing skills.

I think that I can improove my coding skills with continous projects.
